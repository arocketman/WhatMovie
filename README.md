# WhatMovie

WhatMovie is an app that helps you find new movies based on your favourite genres. A movie rich database that is going to allow you to find new movies of any genre such as thriller / comedy / action etc.

You can organize your movies into three main categories:

* Liked - Movies you watched and liked.
* Unliked - Movies you dislike.
* Watchlist - Movies you want to watch in the future.

Any movie that gets inserted in one of these category won't be suggested again.
