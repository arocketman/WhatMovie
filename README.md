# WhatMovie

WhatMovie is an app that helps you find new movies based on your favourite genres. A movie rich database that is going to allow you to find new movies of any genre such as thriller / comedy / action etc.

You can organize your movies into three main categories:

* Liked - Movies you watched and liked.
* Unliked - Movies you dislike.
* Watchlist - Movies you want to watch in the future.

Any movie that gets inserted in one of these category won't be suggested again.

themoviedb.org was used as reference movie database and sqlite to create the local movie database.
